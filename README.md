# Service Locator (Unity Package)
This is an implementation of the service locator pattern in Unity using MonoBehaviours, and a prefab in Resources.

Because this repo is in a Unity package format, you must include these files directly as an Embedded Unity Package into your own Unity project to work on this repo. It's recommended to use a Git submodule to let you make commits back to this repo directly.
